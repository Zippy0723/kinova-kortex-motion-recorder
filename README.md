# kinova-kortex-motion-recorder
A simple set of scripts for recording and playing back movements for the Kinova Kortex robot arm. Users manually move the arm to points, save those points, and the script will play the motion back. Useful for setting up route arm actions if you don't want to use moveit! or manually program in a bunch of coordinates. Supports gripping.
